# ETL-Project

Tornado data seems readily available dating back to 1950â€™s. After reviewing the data, we learned that data was collected techniques improved so much around 1990 that is appeared as if the prevalence of tornados doubled.  Therefore, our group decided to collect data for the twenty-five year span of consistently-collected data from 1990-2015.  The primary collector of weather data is National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
